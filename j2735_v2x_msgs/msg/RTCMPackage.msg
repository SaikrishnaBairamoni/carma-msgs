# The RTCMmessage data element contains the stream of octets of the actual RTCM message that is being sent. The
# messageâ€™s contents are defined in RTCM Standard 10403.1 and in RTCM Standard 10402.1 and its successors. Note that
# most RTCM messages are considerably smaller than the size limit defined here, but that some messages may need to be
# broken into smaller messages (as per the rules defined in the RTCM work) in order to be transmitted using V2X
#communications.
